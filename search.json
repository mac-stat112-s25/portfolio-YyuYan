Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\n#ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe? a blank canvas\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function? the name of the dataset\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating? declare the name of the variable on the x-axis\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!? aesthetics\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots.

When do we use it?\n\n‘+’ adds the conditions and layers to the graph\n\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”?\n\nThe bars are in geometric shape\n\nWhat does labs() stand for?\n\nlabels\n\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\n\n‘color’ means the color the outline of the bars and ‘fill’ means fill out the bars\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe?\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\n‘Moderate’ is the most common rating and ‘Difficult’ is the least common rating\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\nthe rating on the x-axis starts from difficult which is not intuitive.\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_bar() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph does not provide useful information on the data\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\n\n6\n\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\n\n2\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nThe elevation ranges from 3700 feet to 5500 feet. Most of hikes ranges from 4000 to 4900. It’s right skewed and the 4000 feet is the most common elevation.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# add histogram of the data 'elevation' to the canvas\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# outline the bars in white\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# fill the bars in blue\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# add axis labels\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# change the width of the bins to 1000 feet\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# change the width of bins to 5 feet \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Change the width of the bins to 200 feet\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry? geom_histogram()\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? ‘color’ outlines the bars and ‘fill’ fills the color\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization? easy to see the bars\nWhat did binwidth do? change the width of bins\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)? can’t see the big picture\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)? can’t see the trend\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nggplot(hikes,aes(x = elevation)) + geom_density(color = \"blue\", fill = 'orange')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\n\nThe trend or the slope of the plot can tell the distribution of the elevation. The typical elevation is the peak of the plot.\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each? Histogram are straightforward to see how frequently values occur in each range, but it is harder to see the overall shape of the distribtion compared to a smooth curve.\nDensity plot provide a smooth curve that helps to understand the shape of distribution, but it is less intuitive to see frequent values.\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why? The subsequent lines should be indented to clarify the new lines\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why? hard to track the component of the function\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files.

Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (#).\n\n# Set up the plotting frame\n# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone?\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))\n\n\n# Add a layer of points for each county\n# Take note of the geom!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Change the shape of the points\n# What happens if you change the shape to another number?\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 3)\n\n\n# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points \"orange\"\n# NOTE: Try to anticipate if \"color\" or \"fill\" will be useful here. Then try both.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(color= \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in\n# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))\n\nExercise 3: Reflect\nSummarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\nThere is strong and positive relationship.\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\npositive\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?) Texas and Utah\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) + geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is negative relationship between median rent and republican support. The older the age is, the higher support.\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t answer the relationship between two variables because the visualization does not have trends.\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states. Republican support in 2020 was highest and most consistent in red states.Purple states had both strong Republican and Democratic counties.Blue states had lower Republican support.\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# scale_fill_manual() manually set the fill colors\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# alpha = 0.5 change the transparency of the fill colors\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# facet_wrap splits your plot into multiple smaller plots based on the unique values of a variable.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# facet_wrap splits your plot into multiple smaller plots based on the unique values of a variable.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible? It is hard to interpret\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best? density plot\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots? density plot shows the entire distribution of the data\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots? density plot can’t show the exact value of the statistics like median\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill  = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options. pro is it is easier to compare the outcomes\ncon is the plot does not show how many counties fall into blue, purple, and red states\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why? My favorite one is side by side bar plot because it shows the count of each category and it is easier to compare which category has the most support\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location))+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = location, fill = raintoday)) + \n  geom_bar()",

The education dataset contains various education variables for each state:\n\n# Import and check out data\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv\")\nhead(education)\n\n       State expend ratio salary frac verbal math  sat  fracCat\n1    Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8    491  538 1029   (0,15]\n2     Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47    445  489  934 (45,100]\n3    Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27    448  496  944  (15,45]\n4   Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6    482  523 1005   (0,15]\n5 California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45    417  485  902  (15,45]\n6   Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29    462  518  980  (15,45]\n\n\nA codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:\n\nExercise 1: SAT scores\nPart a\nConstruct a plot of how the average sat scores vary from state to state.

Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\nthe range is from 850 to around 1100. The typical sat score is 900. The shape is non-normal.\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = expend)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you? higher student expenditures, the worse sat score is\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expend)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\nstates with lower salaries and expenditures have higher sat scores.\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x= fracCat)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\nThe more students to take sat, the lower score they got.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x= sat, fill= fracCat)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell? Does it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\nsat score is positively correlated with expenditure on students when control for the fraction of students who take sat\n\nggplot(education, aes(x= expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?\nThe higher proportion of students take sat, the lower sat score they got and higher expenditure.",

    "text": "Use this file for practice with the spatial viz in-class activity. Refer to the class website for details.\nPart 1: Interactive points on a map with leaflet\n\nLeaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for creating maps. We can use it inside R through the leaflet package.\nThis uses a different plotting framework than ggplot2, but still has a tidyverse feel (which will become more clear as we learn other tidyverse tools!).\nThe general steps are as follows:\n\nCreate a map widget by calling leaflet() and telling it the data to use.\nAdd a base map using addTiles() (the default) or addProviderTiles().\nAdd layers to the map using layer functions (e.g. addMarkers(), addPolygons()).\nPrint the map widget to display it.\nExercise 1: A leaflet with markers / points\nEarlier this semester, I asked for the latitude and longitude of one of your favorite places. I rounded these to the nearest whole number, so that they’re near to but not exactly at those places. Let’s load the data and map it!\n\nfave_places &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/our_fave_places.csv\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(fave_places)\n\n  latitude longitude\n1       59        18\n2       45       -93\n3       33      -117\n4       40       116\n5       40       106\n6       37      -122\n\n\nPart a\nYou can use a “two-finger scroll” to zoom in and out.\n\n# Load the leaflet package\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Just a plotting frame\n#leaflet(data = fave_places)\n\n\n# Now what do we have? a map\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Now what do we have? the points/location on the map\n# longitude and latitude refer to the variables in our data\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers(lng = ~longitude, lat = ~latitude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Since we named them \"longitude\" and \"latitude\", the function\n# automatically recognizes these variables. No need to write them!\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nPLAY AROUND! This map is interactive. Zoom in on one location. Keep zooming – what level of detail can you get into? How does that detail depend upon where you try to zoom in (thus what are the limitations of this tool)?\nExercise 2: Details\nWe can change all sorts of details in leaflet maps.\n\n# Load package needed to change color\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gplots'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    lowess\n\n# We can add colored circles instead of markers at each location\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addCircles(color = col2hex(\"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# We can change the background\n# Mark locations with yellow dots\n# And connect the dots, in their order in the dataset, with green lines\n# (These green lines don't mean anything here, but would if this were somebody's travel path!)\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt;\n  addProviderTiles(\"USGS\") |&gt;\n  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex(\"yellow\")) |&gt;\n  addPolylines(\n    lng = ~longitude,\n    lat = ~latitude,\n    color = col2hex(\"green\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general:\n\naddProviderTiles() changes the base map.\nTo explore all available provider base maps, type providers in the console. (Though some don’t work :/)\n\nUse addMarkers() or addCircles() to mark locations. Type ?addControl into the console to pull up a help file which summarizes the aesthetics of these markers and how you can change them. For example:\n\n\nweight = how thick to make the lines, points, pixels\n\nopacity = transparency (like alpha in ggplot2)\ncolors need to be in “hex” form. We used the col2hex() function from the gplots library to do that\n\n\nExercise 3: Your turn\nThe starbucks data, compiled by Danny Kaplan, contains information about every Starbucks in the world at the time the data were collected, including Latitude and Longitude:\n\n# Import starbucks location data\nstarbucks &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv\")\n\nLet’s focus on only those in Minnesota for now:\n\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nstarbucks_mn &lt;- starbucks |&gt;   \n  filter(Country == \"US\", State.Province == \"MN\")\n\nCreate a leaflet map of the Starbucks locations in Minnesota. Keep it simple – go back to Exercise 1 for an example.\nPart 2: Static points on a map\nLeaflet is very powerful and fun. But:\n\nIt’s not great when we have lots of points to map – it takes lots of time.\nIt makes good interactive maps, but we often need a static map (eg: we can not print interactive maps!).\n\nLet’s explore how to make point maps with ggplot(), not leaflet().\nExercise 3: A simple scatterplot\nLet’s start with the ggplot() tools we already know. Construct a scatterplot of all starbucks locations, not just those in Minnesota, with:\n\nLatitude and Longitude coordinates (which goes on the y-axis?!)\nMake the points transparent (alpha = 0.2) and smaller (size = 0.2)\n\nIt’s pretty cool that the plots we already know can provide some spatial context. But what don’t you like about this plot?\nThere are only dots but no locations symbols\n\nggplot(starbucks, aes(y = Latitude, x = Longitude)) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Adding a country-level background\nLet’s add a background map of country-level boundaries.\nPart a\nFirst, we can grab country-level boundaries from the rnaturalearth package.\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n# Get info about country boundaries across the world\n# in a \"sf\" or simple feature format\nworld_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = \"sf\")\n\nIn your console, type world_boundaries to check out what’s stored there. Don’t print it our in your Rmd – printing it would be really messy there (even just the head()).\nPart b\nRun the chunks below to build up a new map.\n\n# What does this code produce? the code produces a map\n# What geom are we using for the point map? geom_sf\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load package needed to change map theme\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\n\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.

Let’s wrangle our data first. We’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (repub_20_categories) that discretizes the repub_pct_20 variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):\n\n# Don't worry about the code!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- elections_by_state |&gt; \n  filter(state_abbr != \"DC\") |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, repub_pct_20) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(30, 70, by = 5), \n               labels = c(\"30-34\", \"35-39\", \"40-44\", \"45-49\",\n                          \"50-54\", \"55-59\", \"60-64\", \"65-70\"), \n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, county_name, county_fips,\n          repub_pct_20, median_age, median_rent) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n               labels = c(\"0-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30-39\", \"40-49\",\n                          \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70-79\", \"80-89\", \"90-100\"),\n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nExercise 8: State-level choropleth maps\nLet’s map the 2020 Republican support in each state, repub_pct_20.\nPart a\nWe again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on elections in each state, which we already have: elections_by_state.\nA background map of state boundaries in the US. The boundaries we used for point maps don’t work here. (Optional detail: they’re sf objects and we now need a data.frame object.)

These variables must have the same possible outcomes in order to be matched up (alabama, alaska, arizona,…).\n\n\n\nexpand_limits() assures that the map covers the entire area it’s supposed to, by pulling longitudes and latitudes from the states_map.\nPart d\nWe used geom_sf() for point maps. What geom do we use for choropleth maps?\nExercise 9: County-level choropleth maps\nLet’s map the 2020 Republican support in each county.\nPart a\nWe again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on elections in each county, which we already have: elections_by_county.\nA background map of county boundaries in the US, stored in the county_map dataset in the socviz package:\n\n\n# Get the latitude and longitude coordinates of county boundaries\nlibrary(socviz)\ndata(county_map) \n\n# Check it out\nhead(county_map)\n\n     long      lat order  hole piece            group    id\n1 1225889 -1275020     1 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n2 1235324 -1274008     2 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n3 1244873 -1272331     3 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n4 1244129 -1267515     4 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n5 1272010 -1262889     5 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n6 1276797 -1295514     6 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n\n\nPause\nImportant detail: We officially have a headache.

Under 10 words.\nChange the x- and y-axis labels, currently just the names of the variables in the dataset. These should be short and include units.\nChange the legend title to “Location” (just for practice, not because it’s better than “location”).\n\n\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(x = \"temperature at 9 am\", y = \"temperature at 3 pm\", title = \"temperature of Australia at 9am vs 3pm by location\", color = \"location\")  \n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhen we’re including our plot in an article, paper, book, or other similar outlet, we should (and are expected to) provide a more descriptive figure caption. Typically, this is instead of a title and is more descriptive of what exactly is being plotted.\n\nAdd a figure caption in the top of the chunk.\nInclude your x-axis, y-axis, and legend labels from Part a.\nRender your Rmd and check out how the figure caption appears.\n\n\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\nscatter plot showing the relationship between 9 AM and 3PM temperatures in three Australian locations\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Accessibility\nLet’s now make a graphic more accessible.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\")  \n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\nPart a\nLet’s add some alt text that can be picked up by screen readers. This is a great resource on writing alt text for data viz. In short, whereas figure captions are quick descriptions which assume that the viz is accessible, alt text is a longer description which assumes the viz is not accessible. Alt text should concisely articulate:\n\nWhat your visualization is (e.g. a density plot of 3pm temperatures in Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong, Australia).\nA 1-sentence description of the most important takeaway.\nA link to your data source if it’s not already in the caption.\n\nAdd appropriate alt text at the top of the chunk, in fig-alt. Then render your qmd, and hover over the image in your rendered html file to check out the alt text.\n\n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\nDensity plots of 3pm temperatures in 3 Australian locations.\n\n\n\nPart b\nColor is another important accessibility consideration. Let’s check out the color accessibility of our density plot.\n\nRun the ggplot() code from Part a in your console. The viz will pop up in the Plots tab.\nIn the Plots tab, click “Export” then “Save as image”. Save the image somewhere.\nNavigate to https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/\n\nAbove the image of crayons (I think it’s crayons?), click “Choose file” and choose the plot file you just saved.\nClick the various simulator buttons (eg: Red-Weak/Protanomaly) to check out how the colors in this plot might appear to others.\nSummarize what you learn. What impact might our color choices have on one’s ability to interpret the viz?\nPart c\nWe can change our color schemes! There are many color-blind friendly palettes in R. In the future, we’ll set a default, more color-blind friendly color theme at the top of our Rmds. We can also do this individually for any plot that uses color. Run the chunks below to explore various options.\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d()    \n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# In the color scale line:\n# Change \"fill\" to \"color\" since we use color in the aes()\n# Change \"d\" (discrete) to \"c\" (continuous) since maxtemp is on a continuous scale\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = maxtemp)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  labs(x = \"3pm temperature (Celsius)\") + \n  scale_color_viridis_c()\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Ethics\nLet’s scratch the surface of ethics in data viz. Central to this discussion is the consideration of impact.\nPart a\nAt a minimum, our data viz should not mislead. Reconsider the climate change example from above. Why is this plot unethical and what impact might it have on policy, public opinion, etc?\nIt does not start at zero, so the temperature changes look significant. It does not show long term trends\n\nPart b\nAgain, data viz ethical considerations go beyond whether or not a plot is misleading. As described in the warm-up, we need to consider: visibility, privacy, power, emotion & embodiment, pluralism, & context. Depending upon the audience and goals of a data viz, addressing these points might require more nuance. Mainly, the viz tools we’ve learned are a great base or foundation, but aren’t the only approaches to data viz. \nPick one or more of the following examples of data viz to discuss with your group. How do the approaches taken:\n\nemphasize one or more of: visibility, privacy, power, emotion, embodiment, pluralism, and/or context?\nimprove upon what we might be able to convey with a simpler bar chart, scatterplot, etc?\n\n\nExample: W.E.B. Du Bois (1868–1963)\nDu Bois (“Doo Boys”) was a “sociologist, socialist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer, and editor”1. He was also a pioneer in elevating emotion and embodiment in data visualization. For the Paris World Fair of 1900, Du Bois and his team of students from Atlanta University presented 60 data visualizations of the Black experience in America, less than 50 years after the abolishment of slavery. Du Bois noted: “I wanted to set down its aim and method in some outstanding way which would bring my work to notice by the thinking world.” That is, he wanted to increase the impact of his work by partnering technical visualizations with design that better connects to lived experiences. NOTE: This work uses language common to that time period and addresses the topic of slavery. Check out:\n\nA complete set of the data visualizations provided by Anthony Starks (@ajstarks).\nAn article by Allen Hillery (@AlDatavizguy).\n\n\nExample: One person’s experience with long COVID\nNYT article\nIt connects personal experience with data storytelling It uses interactive elements to show symptoms\nExample: Decolonizing data viz\nblog post\n\nExample: Visualizing climate change through art\nFutures North with Prof John Kim & Mac students (by Prof Kim, Mac research students)\n\nExample: Personal data collection\nDear Data\n\nPart c\nFor a deeper treatment of similar topics, and more examples, read Data Feminism.\n\nExercise 4: Critique\nPractice critiquing some more complicated data viz listed at Modern Data Science with R, Exercise 2.5.\nThink about the following questions:\n\nWhat story does the data graphic tell? What is the main message that you take away from it?\nCan the data graphic be described in terms of the Grammar of Graphics (frame, glyphs, aesthetics, facet, scale, guide)? If so, please describe.\nCritique and/or praise the visualization choices made by the designer. Do they work? Are they misleading? Thought-provoking? Are there things that you would have done differently?\n\nthe one I chose is the wind map. It shows the current time wind speed and the direction of wind in the United States. It only shows ten cities and for people who are bad at geography, it’s hard to analyze the graphic.\nExercise 5: Design Details\nThis final exercise is just “food for thought”. It’s more of a discussion than an exercise, and gets into some of the finer design details and data viz theory. Go as deep or not deep as you’d like here.\nIn refining the details of our data viz, Visualize This and Storytelling with Data provide some of their guiding principles. But again, every context is different.\n\nPut yourself in a reader’s shoes. What parts of the data need explanation?\nShine a light on your data. Try to remove any “chart junk” that distracts from the data.\nVary color and style to emphasize the viz elements that are most important to the story you’re telling.\nIt is easier to judge length than it is to judge area or angles.\nBe thoughtful about how your categories are ordered for categorical data.\n\nGetting into even more of the nitty gritty, we need to be mindful of what geometric elements and aesthetics we use. The following elements/aesthetics are listed in roughly descending order of human ability to perceive and compare nearby objects:2\n\nPosition\nLength\nAngle\nDirection\nShape (but only a very few different shapes)\nArea\nVolume\nShade\nColor. (Color is the most difficult, because it is a 3-dimensional quantity.)\n\nFinally, here are some facts to keep in mind about visual perception from Now You See It.\nPart a: Selectivity\nVisual perception is selective, and our attention is often drawn to contrasts from the norm.\nImplication: We should design visualizations so that the features we want to highlight stand out in contrast from those that are not worth the audience’s attention.\nExample: What stands out in this example image? This is originally from C. Ware, Information Visualization: Perception for Design, 2004? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 33.\n The image has patterns\nPart b: Familiarity\nOur eyes are drawn to familiar patterns. We observe what we know and expect.\nImplication: Visualizations work best when they display information as patterns that familiar and easy to spot.\nExample: Do you notice anything embedded in this rose image from coolbubble.com? Source: S. Few, Now You See It, 2009, p. 34.\n\nPart c: Revisit\nRevisit Part b. Do you notice anything in the shadows? Go to https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/rose2.png for an image.\nyes\nWrapping up\nIf you finish early:\n\nWork on homework if not done already\nComplete any activities you haven’t finished yet, eg, spatial viz, the optional but fun exercises in the Multivariate viz and Bivariate viz activities.\nIf you’ve done all that, explore some datasets in TidyTuesday.",

The right approach depends upon your research goals. A general rule is: Only get rid of observations with missing data if they’re missing data on variables you need for the specific task at hand!\n\n\nExample 1\nSuppose our research focus is just on body_mass_g. Two penguins are missing this info:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(body_mass_g)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(body_mass_g))`\n                      &lt;int&gt;\n1                         2\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that removes these penguins:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins_w_body_mass &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g))\n\n# Compare the number of penguins in this vs the original data\nnrow(penguins_w_body_mass)\n\n[1] 342\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nNote that some penguins in penguins_w_body_mass are missing info on sex, but we don’t care since that’s not related to our research question:\n\npenguins_w_body_mass |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(sex)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(sex))`\n              &lt;int&gt;\n1                 9\n\n\nExample 2\nIn the very rare case that we need complete information on every variable for the specific task at hand, we can use na.omit() to get rid of any penguin that’s missing info on any variable:\n\npenguins_complete &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  na.omit()\n\nHow many penguins did this eliminate?\n\nnrow(penguins_complete)\n\n[1] 333\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nPart c\nExplain why we should only use na.omit() in extreme circumstances. It will reduce the datapoints but it has the available information\nExercise 2: More Selecting\nBeing able to select() only certain columns can help simplify our data. This is especially important when we’re working with lots of columns (which we haven’t done yet). It can also get tedious to type out every column of interest. Here are some shortcuts:\n\n\n- removes a given variable and keeps all others (e.g. select(-island))\n\nstarts_with(\"___\"), ends_with(\"___\"), or contains(\"___\") selects only the columns that either start with, end with, or simply contain the given string of characters\n\nUse these shortcuts to create the following datasets.\n\n# First: recall the variable names\nnames(penguins)\n\n[1] \"species\"           \"island\"            \"bill_length_mm\"   \n[4] \"bill_depth_mm\"     \"flipper_length_mm\" \"body_mass_g\"      \n[7] \"sex\"               \"year\"             \n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep everything but the year and island variables\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(-island, -year)\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 6\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex   \n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181        3750 male  \n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186        3800 female\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195        3250 female\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA          NA &lt;NA&gt;  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193        3450 female\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190        3650 male  \n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181        3625 female\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195        4675 male  \n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193        3475 &lt;NA&gt;  \n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190        4250 &lt;NA&gt;  \n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the penguin characteristics measured in mm\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species, ends_with(\"mm\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 4\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195\n 4 Adelie            NA            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1               193\n10 Adelie            42            20.2               190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and bill-related measurements\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species, starts_with(\"bill\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1          18.7\n 2 Adelie            39.5          17.4\n 3 Adelie            40.3          18  \n 4 Adelie            NA            NA  \n 5 Adelie            36.7          19.3\n 6 Adelie            39.3          20.6\n 7 Adelie            38.9          17.8\n 8 Adelie            39.2          19.6\n 9 Adelie            34.1          18.1\n10 Adelie            42            20.2\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the length-related characteristics\npenguins |&gt;\n  select(species, contains(\"length\"))\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 3\n   species bill_length_mm flipper_length_mm\n   &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie            39.1               181\n 2 Adelie            39.5               186\n 3 Adelie            40.3               195\n 4 Adelie            NA                  NA\n 5 Adelie            36.7               193\n 6 Adelie            39.3               190\n 7 Adelie            38.9               181\n 8 Adelie            39.2               195\n 9 Adelie            34.1               193\n10 Adelie            42                 190\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Arranging, Counting, & Grouping by Multiple Variables\nWe’ve done examples where we need to filter() by more than one variable, or select() more than one variable.

Dates are a whole special object type or class in R that automatically respect the order of time.\n\n# Get today's date\nas.Date(today())\n\n[1] \"2025-04-07\"\n\n# Let's store this as \"today\" so we can work with it below\ntoday &lt;- as.Date(today())\n\n# Check out the class of this object\nclass(today)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nThe lubridate package inside tidyverse contains functions that can extract various information from dates. Let’s learn about some of the most common functions by applying them to today. For each, make a comment on what the function does\n\nyear(today)\n\n[1] 2025\n\n\n\n# today's month\nmonth(today)\n\n[1] 4\n\nmonth(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Apr\n12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec\n\n\n\n# now is the 9th week of the year \nweek(today)\n\n[1] 14\n\n\n\n# mday(): day of the month, yday(): day of the year\nmday(today)\n\n[1] 7\n\nyday(today)  # This is often called the \"Julian day\"\n\n[1] 97\n\n\n\n# day of the week as a number or label\nwday(today)\n\n[1] 2\n\nwday(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Mon\nLevels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat\n\n\n\n# today is before or after 2.14\ntoday &gt;= ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ntoday &lt; ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] FALSE",

Let’s apply these ideas to the daily Birthdays dataset in the mosaic package.\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\n\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.

We can use our wrangling skills to understand some drivers of daily births. Putting these all together can be challenging!

And get rid of any rows missing information on broad_group. You’ll learn the code soon! For now, just run this chunk:\n\nplot_data &lt;- daily |&gt; \n  mutate(broad_group = case_when(\n    group %in% c(\"Acting\", \"Athletics\", \"Comedy\", \"Musician\") ~ \"Acting, Comedy & Music\",\n    group %in% c(\"Media\", \"media\", \"Science\", \"Academic\", \"Consultant\", \"Clergy\") ~ \"Media\",\n    group %in% c(\"Politician\", \"Political Aide\", \"Government\", \"Military\", \"Business\", \"Advocacy\") ~ \"Government and Politics\",\n    .default = NA\n  )) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(broad_group))\n\nNow, using the broad_group variable in plot_data, recreate the graphic from the article, with three different lines showing the fraction of guests in each group over time. Note: You’ll have to wrangle the data first.\n\nplot_data |&gt;\n  group_by(year, broad_group) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n()) |&gt;\n  mutate(freq = n / sum(n)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y = freq, x = year, color = broad_group)) + \n    geom_line()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'.

    "text": "Exercise 1: Where are my keys?\nPart a\nDefine two new datasets, with different students and courses:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nstudents_2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"D\", \"E\", \"F\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_2\n\n  student    class\n1       D COMP 101\n2       E BIOL 101\n3       F POLI 101\n\nenrollments_2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  course = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  enrollment = c(18, 20, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_2\n\n    course enrollment\n1  ART 101         18\n2 BIOL 101         20\n3 COMP 101         19\n\n\nTo connect the course enrollments to the students’ courses, try do a left_join(). You get an error! Identify the problem by reviewing the error message and the datasets we’re trying to join.\n\n# eval = FALSE: don't evaluate this chunk when knitting. it produces an error.\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2)\n\nPart b\nThe problem is that course name, the key or variable that links these two datasets, is labeled differently: class in the students_2 data and course in the enrollments_2 data. Thus we have to specify these keys in our code:\n\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(class == course))\n\n  student    class enrollment\n1       D COMP 101         19\n2       E BIOL 101         20\n3       F POLI 101         NA\n\n\n\n# The order of the keys is important:\n# join_by(\"left data key\" == \"right data key\")\n# The order is mixed up here, thus we get an error:\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(course == class))\n\nPart c\nDefine another set of fake data which adds grade information:\n\n# Add student grades in each course\nstudents_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"Y\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"Z\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"S\", \"C\", \"A\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_3\n\n  student    class grade\n1       Y COMP 101     B\n2       Y BIOL 101     S\n3       Z POLI 101     C\n4       Z COMP 101     A\n\n# Add average grades in each course\nenrollments_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  class = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\",\"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  enrollment = c(20, 18, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_3\n\n     class grade enrollment\n1  ART 101     B         20\n2 BIOL 101     A         18\n3 COMP 101    A-         19\n\n\nTry doing a left_join() to link the students’ classes to their enrollment info. Did this work? Try and figure out the culprit by examining the output.\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(class, grade)`\n\n\n  student    class grade enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101     B         NA\n2       Y BIOL 101     S         NA\n3       Z POLI 101     C         NA\n4       Z COMP 101     A         NA\n\n\nPart d\nThe issue here is that our datasets have 2 column names in common: class and grade. BUT grade is measuring 2 different things here: individual student grades in students_3 and average student grades in enrollments_3. Thus it doesn’t make sense to try to join the datasets with respect to this variable. We can again solve this by specifying that we want to join the datasets using the class variable as a key. What are grade.x and grade.y?\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3, join_by(class == class))\n\n  student    class grade.x grade.y enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101       B      A-         19\n2       Y BIOL 101       S       A         18\n3       Z POLI 101       C    &lt;NA&gt;         NA\n4       Z COMP 101       A      A-         19\n\n\nExercise 2: More small practice\nBefore applying these ideas to bigger datasets, let’s practice identifying which join is appropriate in different scenarios. Define the following fake data on voters (people who have voted) and contact info for voting age adults (people who could vote):\n\n# People who have voted\nvoters &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = c(\"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"),\n  times_voted = c(2, 4, 17, 6, 20)\n)\n\nvoters\n\n  id times_voted\n1  A           2\n2  D           4\n3  E          17\n4  F           6\n5  G          20\n\n# Contact info for voting age adults\ncontact &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n  address = c(\"summit\", \"grand\", \"snelling\", \"fairview\"),\n  age = c(24, 89, 43, 38)\n)\n\ncontact\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    B    grand  89\n3    C snelling  43\n4    D fairview  38\n\n\nUse the appropriate join for each prompt below. In each case, think before you type:\n\nWhat dataset goes on the left?\nWhat do you want the resulting dataset to look like? How many rows and columns will it have?\n\n\n# 1. We want contact info for people who HAVEN'T voted\ncontact |&gt; \n  anti_join(voters, join_by(name == id))\n\n  name  address age\n1    B    grand  89\n2    C snelling  43\n\n# 2. We want contact info for people who HAVE voted\ncontact |&gt;\n  semi_join(voters, join_by(name == id))\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    D fairview  38\n\n# 3. We want any data available on each person\ncontact |&gt; \n  full_join(voters, join_by(name == id))\n\n  name  address age times_voted\n1    A   summit  24           2\n2    B    grand  89          NA\n3    C snelling  43          NA\n4    D fairview  38           4\n5    E     &lt;NA&gt;  NA          17\n6    F     &lt;NA&gt;  NA           6\n7    G     &lt;NA&gt;  NA          20\n\n# 4. When possible, we want to add contact info to the voting roster\nvoters |&gt; \n  full_join(contact, join_by(id == name))\n\n  id times_voted  address age\n1  A           2   summit  24\n2  D           4 fairview  38\n3  E          17     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n4  F           6     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n5  G          20     &lt;NA&gt;  NA\n6  B          NA    grand  89\n7  C          NA snelling  43\n\n\nExercise 3: Bigger datasets\nLet’s apply these ideas to some bigger datasets. In grades, each row is a student-class pair with information on:\n\n\nsid = student ID\n\ngrade = student’s grade\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\n\n\n     sid grade   sessionID\n1 S31185    D+ session1784\n2 S31185    B+ session1785\n3 S31185    A- session1791\n4 S31185    B+ session1792\n5 S31185    B- session1794\n6 S31185    C+ session1795\n\n\nIn courses, each row corresponds to a class section with information on:\n\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\ndept = department\n\nlevel = course level (eg: 100)\n\nsem = semester\n\nenroll = enrollment (number of students)\n\niid = instructor ID\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\nUse R code to take a quick glance at the data.\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the grades data?\ndim(grades)\n\n[1] 5844    3\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the courses data?\ndim(courses)\n\n[1] 1718    6\n\n\nExercise 4: Class size\nHow big are the classes?\nPart a\nBefore digging in, note that some courses are listed twice in the courses data:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  count(sessionID) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n     sessionID n\n1  session2047 2\n2  session2067 2\n3  session2448 2\n4  session2509 2\n5  session2541 2\n6  session2824 2\n7  session2826 2\n8  session2862 2\n9  session2897 2\n10 session3046 2\n11 session3057 2\n12 session3123 2\n13 session3243 2\n14 session3257 2\n15 session3387 2\n16 session3400 2\n17 session3414 2\n18 session3430 2\n19 session3489 2\n20 session3524 2\n21 session3629 2\n22 session3643 2\n23 session3821 2\n\n\nIf we pick out just 1 of these, we learn that some courses are cross-listed in multiple departments:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  filter(sessionID == \"session2047\")\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session2047    g   100 FA2001     12 inst436\n2 session2047    m   100 FA2001     28 inst436\n\n\nFor our class size exploration, obtain the total enrollments in each sessionID, combining any cross-listed sections. Save this as courses_combined. NOTE: There’s no joining to do here!\n\ncourses_combined &lt;- courses |&gt;\n  group_by(sessionID) |&gt;\n  summarize(enroll = sum(enroll))\n\n# Check that this has 1695 rows and 2 columns\ndim(courses_combined)\n\n[1] 1695    2\n\n\nPart b\nLet’s first examine the question of class size from the administration’s viewpoint. To this end, calculate the median class size across all class sections. (The median is the middle or 50th percentile. Unlike the mean, it’s not skewed by outliers.) THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\n\n\ncourses_combined |&gt; \n  summarize(median(enroll))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `median(enroll)`\n             &lt;int&gt;\n1               18\n\n\nPart c\nBut how big are classes from the student perspective? To this end, calculate the median class size for each individual student. Once you have the correct output, store it as student_class_size. THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest? Which join function will you need?\n\n\nstudent_class_size &lt;- grades |&gt; \n  left_join(courses_combined) |&gt; \n  group_by(sid) |&gt; \n  summarize(med_class = median(enroll))\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(sessionID)`\n\nhead(student_class_size)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  sid    med_class\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 S31185      23.5\n2 S31188      21  \n3 S31191      25  \n4 S31194      15  \n5 S31197      24  \n6 S31200      21  \n\n\nPart d\nThe median class size varies from student to student. To get a sense for the typical student experience and range in student experiences, construct and discuss a histogram of the median class sizes experienced by the students.\n\nggplot(student_class_size, aes(x = med_class)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Narrowing in on classes\nPart a\nShow data on the students that enrolled in session1986. THINK FIRST: Which of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\n\ngrades |&gt; \n  filter(sessionID == \"session1986\")\n\n     sid grade   sessionID\n1 S31401    B+ session1986\n2 S32247     B session1986\n\n\nPart b\nBelow is a dataset with all courses in department E:\n\ndept_E &lt;- courses |&gt; \n  filter(dept == \"E\")\n\nWhat students enrolled in classes in department E? (We just want info on the students, not the classes.)\n\ngrades |&gt; \n  semi_join(dept_E)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(sessionID)`\n\n\n      sid grade   sessionID\n1  S31245     A session2326\n2  S31470     B session3658\n3  S31470     B session3798\n4  S31470     A session3799\n5  S31938     A session2326\n6  S31968     A session3104\n7  S32022     A session3798\n8  S32046    A- session2326\n9  S32226     A session2326\n10 S32415     B session2835\n11 S32415    B+ session3799\n12 S32484    A- session3658\n\n\nExercise 6: All the wrangling\nUse all of your wrangling skills to answer the following prompts! THINK FIRST:\n\nThink about what tables you might need to join (if any). Identify the corresponding variables to match.\nYou’ll need an extra table to convert grades to grade point averages:\n\n\ngpa_conversion &lt;- tibble(\n  grade = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"C+\", \"C\", \"C-\", \"D+\", \"D\", \"D-\", \"NC\", \"AU\", \"S\"), \n  gp = c(4.3, 4, 3.7, 3.3, 3, 2.7, 2.3, 2, 1.7, 1.3, 1, 0.7, 0, NA, NA)\n)\n\ngpa_conversion\n\n# A tibble: 15 × 2\n   grade    gp\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 A+      4.3\n 2 A       4  \n 3 A-      3.7\n 4 B+      3.3\n 5 B       3  \n 6 B-      2.7\n 7 C+      2.3\n 8 C       2  \n 9 C-      1.7\n10 D+      1.3\n11 D       1  \n12 D-      0.7\n13 NC      0  \n14 AU     NA  \n15 S      NA  \n\n\nPart a\nHow many total student enrollments are there in each department?

Let’s get the data ready for that analysis here. Make the following changes to the courses_clean data. Because they have different enrollment structures, and we don’t want to compare apples and oranges, remove the following:\n\nall sections in PE and INTD (interdisciplinary studies courses)\nall music ensembles and dance practicums, i.e. all MUSI and THDA classes with numbers less than 100. HINT: !(dept == \"MUSI\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100)\nall lab sections. Be careful which variable you use here. For example, you don’t want to search by “Lab” and accidentally eliminate courses with words such as “Labor”.\n\nSave the results as enrollments (don’t overwrite courses_clean).\n\nenrollments &lt;- courses_clean |&gt; \n  filter(dept != \"PE\", dept != \"INTD\") |&gt; \n  filter(!(dept == \"MUSI\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100)) |&gt; \n  filter(!(dept == \"THDA\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100)) |&gt; \n  filter(!str_detect(section, \"L\"))\n  \nhead(enrollments)\n\n  dept number section   crn                                                name\n1 AMST    112      01 10318         Introduction to African American Literature\n2 AMST    194      01 10073              Introduction to Asian American Studies\n3 AMST    194      F1 10072 What’s After White Empire - And Is It Already Here?\n4 AMST    203      01 10646 Politics and Inequality: The American Welfare State\n5 AMST    205      01 10842                         Trans Theories and Politics\n6 AMST    209      01 10474                   Civil Rights in the United States\n   days            time      room             instructor avail max enroll\n1 M W F 9:40 - 10:40 am  MAIN 009       Daylanne English     3  20     17\n2 M W F  1:10 - 2:10 pm MUSIC 219          Jake Nagasawa    -4  16     20\n3  T R   3:00 - 4:30 pm   HUM 214 Karin Aguilar-San Juan     0  14     14\n4 M W F 9:40 - 10:40 am  CARN 305          Lesley Lavery     3  25     22\n5  T R   3:00 - 4:30 pm  MAIN 009              Myrl Beam    -2  20     22\n6   W   7:00 - 10:00 pm  MAIN 010         Walter Greason    -1  15     16\n\n\nExercise 6: Enrollment & departments\nExplore enrollments by department. You decide what research questions to focus on. Use both visual and numerical summaries.\nAverage enrollment by department\n\nenrollments |&gt; \n  group_by(dept) |&gt; \n  summarize(avg_enroll = mean(enroll, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(avg_enroll))\n\n# A tibble: 38 × 2\n   dept  avg_enroll\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 CHEM        24.6\n 2 MATH        21.3\n 3 STAT        20.9\n 4 PSYC        20.8\n 5 PHYS        20.5\n 6 ECON        19.4\n 7 BIOL        19.4\n 8 ENVI        18.9\n 9 COMP        18.2\n10 GEOL        17.9\n# ℹ 28 more rows\n\nenrollments |&gt; \n  group_by(dept) |&gt; \n  filter(n() &gt;= 5) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(dept, enroll, FUN = median), y = enroll)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Enrollment Distribution by Department\",\n       x = \"Department\", y = \"Enrollment\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Enrollment & faculty\nLet’s now explore enrollments by instructor. In doing so, we have to be cautious of cross-listed courses that are listed under multiple different departments. Uncomment the code lines in the chunk below for an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\n\nenrollments |&gt;\n  filter(dept %in% c(\"STAT\", \"COMP\"), number == 112, section == \"01\")\n\n  dept number section   crn                         name  days           time\n1 COMP    112      01 10248 Introduction to Data Science  T R  3:00 - 4:30 pm\n2 STAT    112      01 10249 Introduction to Data Science  T R  3:00 - 4:30 pm\n      room        instructor avail max enroll\n1 OLRI 254 Brianna Heggeseth     1  28     27\n2 OLRI 254 Brianna Heggeseth     1  28     27\n\n\nNotice that these are the exact same section! In order to not double count an instructor’s enrollments, we can keep only the courses that have distinct() combinations of days, time, instructor values. Uncomment the code lines in the chunk below.\n\nenrollments_2 &lt;- enrollments |&gt;\n  distinct(days, time, instructor, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n# NOTE: By default this keeps the first department alphabetically\n# That's fine because we won't use this to analyze department enrollments!\nenrollments_2 |&gt;\n  filter(instructor == \"Brianna Heggeseth\", name == \"Introduction to Data Science\")\n\n  dept number section   crn                         name  days           time\n1 COMP    112      01 10248 Introduction to Data Science  T R  3:00 - 4:30 pm\n      room        instructor avail max enroll\n1 OLRI 254 Brianna Heggeseth     1  28     27\n\n\nNow, explore enrollments by instructor. You decide what research questions to focus on. Use both visual and numerical summaries.\nCAVEAT: The above code doesn’t deal with co-taught courses that have more than one instructor. Thus instructors that co-taught are recorded as a pair, and their co-taught enrollments aren’t added to their total enrollments. This is tough to get around with how the data were scraped as the instructor names are smushed together, not separated by a comma!\n\n#top instructors by total enrollments\nenrollments_2 |&gt; \n  group_by(instructor) |&gt; \n  summarize(total_enroll = sum(enroll, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_enroll)) |&gt; \n  head(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   instructor         total_enroll\n   &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Andrew Beveridge             88\n 2 Kristin Heysse               78\n 3 Cari Gillen-O'Neel           75\n 4 Lori Ziegelmeier             73\n 5 Lian Duan                    71\n 6 Mario Solis-Garcia           66\n 7 Alicia Johnson               64\n 8 Kelsey Boyle                 64\n 9 Susan Green                  64\n10 Thomas Varberg               62\n\nenrollments_2 |&gt; \n  group_by(instructor) |&gt; \n  summarize(total_enroll = sum(enroll, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_enroll)) |&gt; \n  slice_max(order_by = total_enroll, n = 10) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(instructor, total_enroll), y = total_enroll)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Instructors by Total Enrollment\",\n       x = \"Instructor\", y = \"Total Enrollment\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional extra practice\n\n# Make a bar plot showing the number of night courses by day of the week\n# Use courses_clean\n\nDig Deeper: regex\nExample 4 gave 1 small example of a regular expression.\nThese are handy when we want process a string variable, but there’s no consistent pattern by which to do this. You must think about the structure of the string and how you can use regular expressions to capture the patterns you want (and exclude the patterns you don’t want).\nFor example, how would you describe the pattern of a 10-digit phone number? Limit yourself to just a US phone number for now.\n\nThe first 3 digits are the area code.\nThe next 3 digits are the exchange code.\nThe last 4 digits are the subscriber number.\n\nThus, a regular expression for a US phone number could be:\n\n\n[:digit:]{3}-[:digit:]{3}-[:digit:]{4} which limits you to XXX-XXX-XXXX pattern or\n\n\\\\([:digit:]{3}\\\\) [:digit:]{3}-[:digit:]{4} which limits you to (XXX) XXX-XXXX pattern or\n\n[:digit:]{3}\\\\.[:digit:]{3}\\\\.[:digit:]{4} which limits you to XXX.XXX.XXXX pattern\n\nThe following would include the three patterns above in addition to the XXXXXXXXXX pattern (no dashes or periods): - [\\\\(]*[:digit:]{3}[-.\\\\)]*[:digit:]{3}[-.]*[:digit:]{4}\nIn order to write a regular expression, you first need to consider what patterns you want to include and exclude.\nWork through the following examples, and the tutorial after them to learn about the syntax.\nEXAMPLES\n\n# Define some strings to play around with\nexample &lt;- \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\n\nstr_replace(example, \"quick\", \"really quick\")\n\n[1] \"The really quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"(fox|dog)\", \"****\") # | reads as OR\n\n[1] \"The quick brown **** jumps over the lazy ****.\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"(fox|dog).\", \"****\") # \".\" for any character\n\n[1] \"The quick brown ****jumps over the lazy ****\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"(fox|dog)\\\\.$\", \"****\") # at end of sentence only, \"\\\\.\" only for a period\n\n[1] \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ****\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"the\", \"a\") # case-sensitive only matches one\n\n[1] \"The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"[Tt]he\", \"a\") # # will match either t or T; could also make \"a\" conditional on capitalization of t\n\n[1] \"a quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\nstr_replace_all(example, \"[Tt]he\", \"a\") # first match only\n\n[1] \"a quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog.\"\n\n\n\n# More examples\nexample2 &lt;- \"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, / And sorry I could not travel both / And be one traveler, long I stood / And looked down one as far as I could\"\nexample3 &lt;- \"This is a test\"\n\n# Store the examples in 1 place\nexamples &lt;- c(example, example2, example3)\n\n\npat &lt;- \"[^aeiouAEIOU ]{3}\" # Regular expression for three straight consonants.

    "text": "Exercise 1: Save Data Locally\nPart a\nOn your laptop:\n\nDownload the “imdb_5000_messy.csv” file from Moodle\nMove it to the data folder in your portfolio repository\nPart b\nHot tip: After saving your data file, it’s important to record appropriate citations and info in either a new qmd (eg: “imdb_5000_messy_README.qmd”) or in the qmd where you’ll analyze the data. These citations should include:\n\nthe data source, i.e. where you found the data\nthe data creator, i.e. who / what group collected the original data\npossibly a data codebook, i.e. descriptions of the data variables\n\nTo this end, check out where we originally got our IMDB data:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata\nAfter visiting that website, take some quick notes here on the data source and creator.\nExercise 2: Import Data to RStudio\nNow that we have a local copy of our data file, let’s get it into RStudio! Remember that this process depends on 2 things: the file type and location. Since our file type is a csv, we can import it using read_csv(). But we have to supply the file location through a file path. To this end, we can either use an absolute file path or a relative file path.\nPart a\nAn absolute file path describes the location of a file starting from the root or home directory. How we refer to the user root directory depends upon your machine:\n\nOn a Mac: ~\n\nOn Windows: typically C:\\\n\n\nThen the complete file path to the IMDB data file in the data folder, depending on your machine an where you created your portfolio project, can be:\n\nOn a Mac: ~/Desktop/portfolio/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: C:\\Desktop\\portfolio\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or C:\\\\Desktop\\\\portfolio\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate absolute file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_messy.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nimdb_messy &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/apple/Comp 112/portfolio-YyuYan/ica/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\nNew names:\nRows: 5043 Columns: 29\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(12): color, director_name, actor_2_name, genres, actor_1_name, movie_ti... dbl\n(17): ...1, num_critic_for_reviews, duration, director_facebook_likes, a...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt; `...1`\n\n\nPart b\nAbsolute file paths can get really long, depending upon our number of sub-folders, and they should not be used when sharing code with other and instead relative file paths should be used. A relative file path describes the location of a file from the current “working directory”, i.e. where RStudio would currently look for on your computer. Check what your working directory is inside this qmd:\n\n# This should be the folder where you stored this qmd!\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/apple/Comp 112/portfolio-YyuYan/ica\"\n\n\nNext, check what the working directory is for the console by typing getwd() in the console. This is probably different, meaning that the relative file paths that will work in your qmd won’t work in the console! You can either exclusively work inside your qmd, or change the working directory in your console, by navigating to the following in the upper toolbar: Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File location.\nPart c\nAs a good practice, we created a data folder and saved our data file (imdb_5000_messy.csv) into.\nSince our .qmd analysis and .csv data live in the same project, we don’t have to write out absolute file paths that go all the way to the root directory. We can use relative file paths that start from where our code file exists to where the data file exist:\n\nOn a Mac: ../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: ..\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or ..\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nNOTE: .. means go up one level in the file hierarchy, ie, go to the parent folder/directory.\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate relative file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_temp (temp for “temporary”). Convince yourself that this worked, i.e. you get the same dataset as imdb_messy.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/apple/Comp 112/portfolio-YyuYan/ica/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\nNew names:\nRows: 5043 Columns: 29\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(12): color, director_name, actor_2_name, genres, actor_1_name, movie_ti... dbl\n(17): ...1, num_critic_for_reviews, duration, director_facebook_likes, a...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt; `...1`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Paths\n\n\n\nAbsolute file paths should be used when referring to files hosed on the web, eg, https://mac-stat.github.io/data/kiva_partners2.csv. In all other instances, relative file paths should be used.\n\n\nPart d: OPTIONAL\nSometimes, we don’t want to import the entire dataset. For example, we might want to…\n\nskips some rows, eg, if they’re just “filler”\nonly import the first “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\nonly import a random subset of “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\n\nThe “data import cheat sheet” at the top of this qmd, or Google, are handy resources here. As one example…\n\n# Try importing only the first 5 rows\n# read_csv(\"___\", n_max = ___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\nExercise 3: Check Data\nAfter importing new data into RStudio, you MUST do some quick checks of the data. Here are two first steps that are especially useful.\nPart a\nOpen imdb_messy in the spreadsheet-like viewer by typing View(imdb_messy) in the console. Sort this “spreadsheet” by different variables by clicking on the arrows next to the variable names.

Is there anything you’d need to clean before using this data?\n\nclean the n/a value\nExercise 4: Clean Data: Factor Variables 1\nIf you didn’t already in Exercise 3, check out the color variable in the imdb_messy dataset.\n\nWhat’s goofy about this / what do we need to fix?\nMore specifically, what different categories does the color variable take, and how many movies fall into each of these categories?\n\n\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  color               n\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n1 B&W                10\n2 Black and White   199\n3 COLOR              30\n4 Color            4755\n5 color              30\n6 &lt;NA&gt;               19\n\n\nExercise 5: Clean Data: Factor Variables 2\nWhen working with categorical variables like color, the categories must be “clean”, i.e. consistent and in the correct format. Let’s make that happen.\nPart a\nWe could open the .csv file in, say, Excel or Google sheets, clean up the color variable, save a clean copy, and then reimport that into RStudio. BUT that would be the wrong thing to do. Why is it important to use R code, which we then save inside this qmd, to clean our data?\nit is important to keep the records of data cleaning\nPart b\nLet’s use R code to change the color variable so that it appropriately combines the various categories into only 2: Color and Black_White. We’ve learned a couple sets of string-related tools that could be handy here. First, starting with the imdb_messy data, change the color variable using one of the functions we learned in the Factors lesson.\nfct_relevel(), fct_recode(), fct_reorder()\nStore your results in imdb_temp (don’t overwrite imdb_messy). To check your work, print out a count() table of the color variable in imdb_temp.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  mutate(color = fct_recode(color,\n                            \"Color\" = \"COLOR\",\n                            \"Color\" = \"color\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"B&W\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"Black and White\"))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt; \n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 &lt;NA&gt;           19\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat Part b using one of our string functions from the String lesson:\nstr_replace(), str_replace_all(), str_to_lower(), str_sub(), str_length(), str_detect()\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  mutate(color = str_replace(color, \"COLOR\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"color\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"B&W\", \"Black_White\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"Black and White\", \"Black_White\"))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt; \n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 &lt;NA&gt;           19\n\n\nExercise 6: Clean Data: Missing Data 1\nThroughout these exercises, you’ve probably noticed that there’s a bunch of missing data. This is encoded as NA (not available) in R. There are a few questions to address about missing data:\n\n\nHow many values are missing data? What’s the volume of the missingness?\n\nWhy are some values missing?\n\nWhat should we do about the missing values?\n\nLet’s consider the first 2 questions in this exercise.\nPart a\nAs a first step, let’s simply understand the volume of NAs. Specifically:\n\n# Count the total number of rows in imdb_messy\nnrow(imdb_messy)\n\n[1] 5043\n\n# Then count the number of NAs in each column\ncolSums(is.na(imdb_messy))\n\n                     ...1                     color             director_name \n                        0                        19                       104 \n   num_critic_for_reviews                  duration   director_facebook_likes \n                       50                        15                       104 \n   actor_3_facebook_likes              actor_2_name    actor_1_facebook_likes \n                       23                        13                         7 \n                    gross                    genres              actor_1_name \n                      884                         0                         7 \n              movie_title           num_voted_users cast_total_facebook_likes \n                        0                         0                         0 \n             actor_3_name      facenumber_in_poster             plot_keywords \n                       23                        13                       153 \n          movie_imdb_link      num_user_for_reviews                  language \n                        0                        21                        12 \n                  country            content_rating                    budget \n                        5                       303                       492 \n               title_year    actor_2_facebook_likes                imdb_score \n                      108                        13                         0 \n             aspect_ratio      movie_facebook_likes \n                      329                         0 \n\n# Then count the number of NAs in a specific column\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  filter(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes))\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 29\n   ...1 color director_name     num_critic_for_reviews duration\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  4503 Color Léa Pool                              23       97\n2  4520 Color Harry Gantz                           12      105\n3  4721 Color U.

Study the individual observations with NAs carefully. Why do you think they are missing? Are certain films more likely to have more NAs than others?\nfilms with no actor have a lot of missing values\nPart c\nConsider a more specific example. Obtain a dataset of movies that are missing data on actor_1_facebook_likes. Then explain why you think there are NAs.

There is no perfect or universal approach here. Rather, we must think carefully about…\n\nWhy the values are missing?\nWhat we want to do with our data?\nWhat is the impact of removing or replacing missing data on our work / conclusions?\n\nPart a\nCalculate the average duration of a film. THINK: How can we deal with the NA’s?\n\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  summarize(mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE)`\n                           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                           107.\n\n\nFollow-up:\nHow are the NAs dealt with here? Did we have to create and save a new dataset in order to do this analysis?\nPart b\nTry out the drop_na() function:\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- drop_na(imdb_messy)\n\nFollow-up questions:\n\nWhat did drop_na() do? How many data points are left?\nIn what situations might this function be a good idea?\nIn what situations might this function be a bad idea?\nPart c\ndrop_na() removes data points that have any NA values, even if we don’t care about the variable(s) for which data is missing. This can result in losing a lot of data points that do have data on the variables we actually care about! For example, suppose we only want to explore the relationship between film duration and whether it’s in color. Check out a plot:\n\nggplot(imdb_messy, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) +\n  geom_density()\n\nWarning: Removed 15 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nCreate a new dataset with only and all movies that have complete info on duration and color. HINT: You could use !is.na(___) or drop_na() (differently than above)\nUse this new dataset to create a new and improved plot.\nHow many movies remain in your new dataset? Hence why this is better than using the dataset from part b?\n\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  select(duration, color) |&gt; \n  drop_na()\ndim(imdb_temp)\n\n[1] 5010    2\n\n\nPart d\nIn some cases, missing data is more non-data than unknown data. For example, the films with NAs for actor_1_facebook_likes actually have 0 Facebook likes–they don’t even have actors! In these cases, we can replace the NAs with a 0. Use the replace_na() function to create a new dataset (imdb_temp) that replaces the NAs in actor_1_facebook_likes with 0. You’ll have to check out the help file for this function.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  mutate(actor_1_facebook_likes =\n         replace_na(actor_1_facebook_likes, 0))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes))`\n                                 &lt;int&gt;\n1                                    0\n\n\nExercise 8: New Data + Projects\nLet’s practice the above ideas while also planting some seeds for the course project. Each group will pick and analyze their own dataset. The people you’re sitting with today aren’t necessarily your project groups! BUT do some brainstorming together:\n\nShare with each other: What are some personal hobbies or passions or things you’ve been thinking about or things you’d like to learn more about? Don’t think too hard about this! Just share what’s at the top of mind today.\nEach individual: Find a dataset online that’s related to one of the topics you shared in the above prompt.\nDiscuss what data you found with your group!\nLoad the data into RStudio, perform some basic checks, and perform some preliminary cleaning, as necessary.",
