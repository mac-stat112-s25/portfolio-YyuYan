Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt.

Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\n#ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe? a blank canvas\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function? the name of the dataset\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating? declare the name of the variable on the x-axis\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!? aesthetics\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# add bar plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# add x-axis and y-axis labels\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# add color to the bars\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# add color to the bars' outline \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# change the theme of the canvas\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it?\n\n‘+’ adds the conditions and layers to the graph\n\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”?\n\nThe bars are in geometric shape\n\nWhat does labs() stand for?\n\nlabels\n\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\n\n‘color’ means the color the outline of the bars and ‘fill’ means fill out the bars\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe?\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\n‘Moderate’ is the most common rating and ‘Difficult’ is the least common rating\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\nthe rating on the x-axis starts from difficult which is not intuitive.\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_bar() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph does not provide useful information on the data\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\n\n6\n\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\n\n2\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nThe elevation ranges from 3700 feet to 5500 feet. Most of hikes ranges from 4000 to 4900. It’s right skewed and the 4000 feet is the most common elevation.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# add histogram of the data 'elevation' to the canvas\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# outline the bars in white\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# fill the bars in blue\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# add axis labels\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# change the width of the bins to 1000 feet\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# change the width of bins to 5 feet \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Change the width of the bins to 200 feet\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry? geom_histogram()\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? ‘color’ outlines the bars and ‘fill’ fills the color\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization? easy to see the bars\nWhat did binwidth do? change the width of bins\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)? can’t see the big picture\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)? can’t see the trend\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nggplot(hikes,aes(x = elevation)) + geom_density(color = \"blue\", fill = 'orange')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\n\nThe trend or the slope of the plot can tell the distribution of the elevation. The typical elevation is the peak of the plot.\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each? Histogram are straightforward to see how frequently values occur in each range, but it is harder to see the overall shape of the distribtion compared to a smooth curve.\nDensity plot provide a smooth curve that helps to understand the shape of distribution, but it is less intuitive to see frequent values.\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why? The subsequent lines should be indented to clarify the new lines\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why? hard to track the component of the function\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files.

We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (#).\n\n# Set up the plotting frame\n# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone?\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))\n\n\n# Add a layer of points for each county\n# Take note of the geom!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Change the shape of the points\n# What happens if you change the shape to another number?\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 3)\n\n\n# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points \"orange\"\n# NOTE: Try to anticipate if \"color\" or \"fill\" will be useful here. Then try both.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(color= \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in\n# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))\n\nExercise 3: Reflect\nSummarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\nThere is strong and positive relationship.\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\npositive\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?) Texas and Utah\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) + geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is negative relationship between median rent and republican support. The older the age is, the higher support.\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t answer the relationship between two variables because the visualization does not have trends.\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states. Republican support in 2020 was highest and most consistent in red states.Purple states had both strong Republican and Democratic counties.Blue states had lower Republican support.\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# scale_fill_manual() manually set the fill colors\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# alpha = 0.5 change the transparency of the fill colors\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# facet_wrap splits your plot into multiple smaller plots based on the unique values of a variable.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# facet_wrap splits your plot into multiple smaller plots based on the unique values of a variable.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible? It is hard to interpret\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best? density plot\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots? density plot shows the entire distribution of the data\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots? density plot can’t show the exact value of the statistics like median\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill  = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options. pro is it is easier to compare the outcomes\ncon is the plot does not show how many counties fall into blue, purple, and red states\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why? My favorite one is side by side bar plot because it shows the count of each category and it is easier to compare which category has the most support\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location))+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = location, fill = raintoday)) + \n  geom_bar()",

Refer to the class website for details.\nThe story\nThough far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state’s education system. The education dataset contains various education variables for each state:\n\n# Import and check out data\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv\")\nhead(education)\n\n       State expend ratio salary frac verbal math  sat  fracCat\n1    Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8    491  538 1029   (0,15]\n2     Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47    445  489  934 (45,100]\n3    Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27    448  496  944  (15,45]\n4   Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6    482  523 1005   (0,15]\n5 California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45    417  485  902  (15,45]\n6   Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29    462  518  980  (15,45]\n\n\nA codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:\n\nExercise 1: SAT scores\nPart a\nConstruct a plot of how the average sat scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable – sat not State!)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\nthe range is from 850 to around 1100. The typical sat score is 900. The shape is non-normal.\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = expend)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you? higher student expenditures, the worse sat score is\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expend)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\nstates with lower salaries and expenditures have higher sat scores.\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x= fracCat)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\nThe more students to take sat, the lower score they got.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x= sat, fill= fracCat)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell? Does it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\nsat score is positively correlated with expenditure on students when control for the fraction of students who take sat\n\nggplot(education, aes(x= expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?\nThe higher proportion of students take sat, the lower sat score they got and higher expenditure.",
