title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500, fill = "steelblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Elevation Levels of Hikes",
    subtitle = "Most hikes have elevations between 3000 and 5000 feet",
    x = "Elevation (feet)",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) 
```
