Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = salary, y = sat, color = fracCat)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = expend), alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(group = fracCat)) + 
  labs(
    title = "SAT Scores vs. Teacher Salary, Expenditures & Fraction Taking SAT",
    subtitle = "Higher SAT participation is linked to lower scores; expenditure effects vary",
    x = "Teacher Salary ($)",
    y = "Average SAT Score",
    color = "SAT Participation Rate",
    size = "Per Pupil Expenditure ($)"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ fracCat)  
```
