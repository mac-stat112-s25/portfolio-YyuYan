### Exercise 0: Review {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

How many, or roughly what percent, of the 3000+ counties did the Republican candidate win in 2020?

-   Take a guess.
-   Then make a plot of the `winner` variable.
-   Then discuss what follow-up questions you might have (and that our data might help us answer).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")
ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) + 
  geom_bar()
```
50%? What percent of the 3000+ counties did the Republican candidate win in other years?

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

The `repub_pct_20` variable provides more detail about the Republican support in each county. Construct a plot of `repub_pct_20`.

Notice that the distribution of Republican support from county to county is slightly **left skewed** or **negatively skewed**.

What follow-up questions do you have?

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) + geom_histogram(color = "white")
```


### Exercise 1: Quantitative vs Quantitative Intuition Check {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-important title="Be Quick"}

Don't spend more than 3 minutes on this! 

:::

Below is a **scatterplot** of the Republican support in 2020 vs 2016. Notice that:

-   both variables are quantitative, and get their own axes
-   the *response* variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how `repub_pct_20` might be predicted by `repub_pct_16`, not vice versa

Try to replicate this using `ggplot()`. THINK:

-   What info do you need to set up the canvas?
-   What geometric layer (`geom_???`) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven't learned this yet, just take some guesses.

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/scatterplot_demo.png){width="50%"}

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Exercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables {.unnumbered}

Run each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of `repub_pct_20` vs `repub_pct_16` with different *glyphs* representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (`#`).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Set up the plotting frame
# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone?
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Add a layer of points for each county
# Take note of the geom!
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Change the shape of the points
# What happens if you change the shape to another number?
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point(shape = 3)
```

```{r}
# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points "orange"
# NOTE: Try to anticipate if "color" or "fill" will be useful here. Then try both.
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point(color= "orange")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in
# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run!
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))
```


### Exercise 3: Reflect {.unnumbered}

Summarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on:

-   the strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\
There is strong and positive relationship.
-   the direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\
positive
-   outliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)
Texas and Utah

### Exercise 4: Visualizing trend {.unnumbered}

The trend of the relationship between `repub_pct_20` and `repub_pct_16` is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model "smooth" to the plot:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Construct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does *not* include the individual point glyphs.

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) + geom_smooth()
```


#### Part b {.unnumbered}

By default, `geom_smooth()` adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the "best" *linear model*, we can specify `method = "lm"`. It's pretty similar in this example!

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


### Exercise 5: Your Turn {.unnumbered}

To examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of `repub_pct_20` vs `median_rent`, and `repub_pct_20` vs `median_age`. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of `repub_pct_20`, `median_rent` or `median_age`.

```{r}
# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent)) + 
  geom_point()


# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age)) +
  geom_point() 

```
There is negative relationship between median rent and republican support. The older the age is, the higher support. 

### Exercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot {.unnumbered}

Next, let's explore the relationship between a county's 2020 Republican support `repub_pct_20` and the `historical` political trends in its state. In this case `repub_pct_20` is **quantitative**, but `historical` is **categorical**. Explain why a scatterplot might *not* be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn't it help answer?)

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +
  geom_point()
```
It doesn't answer the relationship between two variables because the visualization does not have trends. 

### Exercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical -- Violins & Boxes {.unnumbered}

Though the above scatterplot *did* group the counties by `historical` category, it's nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let's try adding 2 different `geom` layers to the frame:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Side-by-side violin plots
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +
  geom_violin()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Box plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:

**REFLECT:**

Summarize what you've learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.
Republican support in 2020 was highest and most consistent in red states.Purple states had both strong Republican and Democratic counties.Blue states had lower Republican support.



### Exercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical -- Intuition Check {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-important title="Be Quick"}

Don't spend more than 3 minutes on this! 

:::

We can also visualize the relationship between `repub_pct_20` and `historical` using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each `historical` category. (The plot itself is "bad" but we'll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of `repub_pct_20` alone, to re-create this image.

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/density_demo.png){width="50%"}

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +
  geom_density()
```


### Exercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical -- Density Plots {.unnumbered}

Work through the chunks below and address the comments therein.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Name two "bad" things about this plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# scale_fill_manual() manually set the fill colors
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# alpha = 0.5 change the transparency of the fill colors
# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# facet_wrap splits your plot into multiple smaller plots based on the unique values of a variable.
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red")) +
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```
```{r eval = FALSE}
# facet_wrap splits your plot into multiple smaller plots based on the unique values of a variable.
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red")) +
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```




```{r eval = FALSE}
# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.
# Why is this terrible? It is hard to interpret
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))
```


### Exercise 10 {.unnumbered}

We've now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.

-   Which do you like best?
density plot
-   What is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots?
density plot shows the entire distribution of the data

-   What is one con of density plots relative to boxplots?
density plot can't show the exact value of the statistics like median


### Exercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical -- Intuition Check {.unnumbered}

Finally, let's simply explore who *won* each county in 2020 (`winner_20`) and how this breaks down by `historical` voting trends in the state. That is, let's explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of `winner_20` and `historical`.

::: {.callout-important title="Be Quick"}

Spend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.

:::



![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/barplot_demo.png){width="60%"}

```{r}
# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill  = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar()+
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```


### Exercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical {.unnumbered}

Construct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# A stacked bar plot
# How are the "historical" and "winner_20" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# A faceted bar plot
ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~ historical)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# A side-by-side bar plot
# Note the new argument to geom_bar
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
# A proportional bar plot
# Note the new argument to geom_bar
ggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Name one pro and one con of using the "proportional bar plot" instead of one of the other three options.
pro is it is easier to compare the outcomes

con is the plot does not show how many counties fall into blue, purple, and red states

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

What's your favorite bar plot from part and why?
My favorite one is side by side bar plot because it shows the count of each category and it is easier to compare which category has the most support


### Exercise 13: Practice (now or later) {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-important title="Decide"}

Decide what's best for you:

-   Try this extra practice now.
-   Reflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).

:::

Import some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:

```{r}
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv")
```

Construct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots--there are many ways to do things!. However, don't just throw spaghetti at the wall.

Reflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?

```{r}
# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)


```

```{r}
# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?
ggplot(weather, aes(x = location, fill = raintoday)) + 
  geom_bar()

```
